# Edinburgh Napier University SET07106 Haskell Exercises

**DISCLAIMER:** No one should blindly copy code from this repository (or anywhere really). Use this if you are stuck or just curious about my solution.

This repository contains my solutions to Haskell exercises given on [Mathematics for Software Engineering SET07106 module in Edinburgh Napier University](https://www.modules.napier.ac.uk/Module.aspx?ID=SET07106).

I try to keep everything clean, easily readable and understandable. However, this is still a learning process so there will be imperfections.

## Visual Studio Code Tasks

If you are using Visual Studio Code (not its older sibling Visual Studio, they are different), I have set up several tasks to simplify testing solutions. The task names should be self explanatory.

To run a task execute **Run Task** from the command palette ( `Ctrl + Shift + P` ) and choose from the available tasks. You can also directly trigger a build & run task by executing **Run Build Task** ( `Ctrl + Shift + B` ).
